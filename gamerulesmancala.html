<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are 2 players:
<b>North</b> (orange field) vs. <b>South</b> (green field). You can assign a
field to your computer by clicking <b>one</b> of the 2 'computer' checkboxes
on the left side of the game. Either player starts. Players move - and must
move - in turn. Each player controls the two bins in his field. On his turn
a player picks up <EM>all&nbsp;</EM>the stones of one of his <EM>own&nbsp;</EM>bins
(marked with a white X), and distributes them <EM>one by one&nbsp;</EM>into
the <EM>other three bins&nbsp;</EM>going in an <EM>anti-clockwise&nbsp;</EM>direction.
So, if a bin contains more than 3 stones, the fourth stone will fall back in
the same bin.<BR>

<EM>on his turn&nbsp;</EM>finds both his bins empty, he loses.</font></p>

You can learn the winning strategy by clicking both 'computer' checkboxes on
the left side of the game.</font></p>
