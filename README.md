Mini_Mancala Game Html

Mancala is a very ancient African game,
with variations played by every tribe in Africa and throughout the Indian Ocean countries
(there are literally hundreds of variations of the game called Awele, Kalah, Wari, Pallanguli, Katra, Mefuhva, Chisolo, etc...).
Many believe that Mancala could be the oldest game in the world.
It is estimated to be more than 7,000 years old. The word Mancala means "to transfer" in Arabic.
To transfer, or move, playing counters from one bin to another is the exact premise of the game.


# How to Play
There are 2 players: North (orange field) vs. South (green field).
You can assign a field to your computer by clicking one of the 2 'computer' checkboxes on the left side of the game.
Either player starts.
Players move - and must move - in turn. Each player controls the two bins in his field.
On his turn a player picks up all the stones of one of his own bins (marked with a white X), and distributes them one by one into the other three bins going in an anti-clockwise direction.
So, if a bin contains more than 3 stones, the fourth stone will fall back in the same bin.

# Objective
If a player on his turn finds both his bins empty, he loses.

# Strategy
You can learn the winning strategy by clicking both 'computer' checkboxes on the left side of the game.
